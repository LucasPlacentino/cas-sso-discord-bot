# cas-sso-discord-bot
A Discord bot for authenticating users using CAS SSO.  
Links their Discord account (ID) to their CAS credentials. Users are able to link and unlink their account, and only one Discord ID can be linked to a CAS user.  

### Currently at the idea stage
Possibly replacing [our own previous bot **ULBDiscordBot**](https://github.com/bepolytech/ULBDiscordBot) and inspired by [Opensource-IIITH/Discord-CAS](https://github.com/Opensource-IIITH/Discord-CAS)
